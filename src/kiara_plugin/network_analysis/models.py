"""This module contains the metadata (and other) models that are used in the ``kiara_plugin.network_analysis`` package.

Those models are convenience wrappers that make it easier for *kiara* to find, create, manage and version metadata -- but also
other type of models -- that is attached to data, as well as *kiara* modules.

Metadata models must be a sub-class of [kiara.metadata.MetadataModel][kiara.metadata.MetadataModel]. Other models usually
sub-class a pydantic BaseModel or implement custom base classes.
